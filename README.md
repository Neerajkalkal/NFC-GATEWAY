# NFC Gateway: Smart Attendance & Workplace Management System
# Overview

The NFC Gateway is a smart attendance and workplace management system designed to enhance office efficiency using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Employees can check in and out by simply tapping their NFC-enabled smartphones or NFC cards at designated access points. The system not only records attendance but also provides employees with real-time meeting schedules, project-based chat functionality, and an admin dashboard for monitoring workforce productivity.

# Key Features
1. ### NFC-Based Attendance System 
        Employees tap their NFC-enabled mobile device at an office entry point to mark attendance.

        The system records timestamps, employee details, and location data for tracking.
2. ### Secure Employee Authentication
        Employees log in using email & password or biometric authentication (Face ID/Fingerprint).
        NFC tokens act as unique employee identifiers, preventing fraud.

5. ### Admin Dashboard & Attendance Reports
        Admins can monitor attendance in real time via a web-based dashboard.
        Export Excel reports for payroll and workforce analysis.
        Manage employee data, assign projects, and set meeting schedules.
